# Binary Search Tree (BST)
This project implements a balanced Binary Search Tree (BST) in JavaScript with full functionality for inserting, deleting, and traversing nodes. It also includes methods to:

- Check the height and depth of a node.

- Verify if the tree is balanced.

- Rebalance an unbalanced tree.

- Traverse the tree in level-order, pre-order, in-order, and post-order

The project uses a prettyPrint function to visualize the tree structure in the console.
